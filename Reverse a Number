Write program to reverse a number is discussed here. We can reverse a number using loop and arithmetic operators in both iterative and recursive approaches. 

Input & Output Format:

Input consists of a integer.

Output consists of reversed input.

Sample Input: 

13579

Sample Output: 

97531

solution:
num =int(input())
reversed_num = 0
while num != 0:
    digit = num % 10
    reversed_num = reversed_num * 10 + digit
    num //= 10
print(str(reversed_num))
